## LOLCODE Interpreter

Simple toy [LOLCODE](http://lolcode.org/) Implementation done in Lua for MTA:SA.

### Usage

Since the project has been somewhat ruined with the non-recursive parser, this implementation only supports variables.
Example:
```
HAI 1.2
BTW This is the famous 'Hello World' program
I HAS A text
text R Hello World
VISIBLE text
KTHXBYE
```
